# BitFlipperBox

Welcome to BitFlipperBox, the Python-based programming calculator designed for converting numbers between different basesâ€”decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal. This repository hosts scripts that seamlessly handle both positive and negative integers as well as decimal/fractional values.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of BitFlipperBox is to expedite the conversion process between various numbering systems, particularly useful when working with low-level code at the hardware level. By avoiding Python's default conversion functions, this project aims to provide deeper insights and understanding of the underlying logic and rationale of these numbering systems. Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or a professional working in fields like computer science, electronics, or software engineering, these tools are crafted to enhance your workflow and knowledge.

## Features
- **Manual Conversion Logic**: Delve into the mechanics of number systems with custom-built conversion functions.
- **Support for Various Number Types**: Works with both integral and fractional numbers, ensuring wide applicability.
- **Digit Grouping**: Enhances readability and usability by grouping digits in the output according to each numbering system's standards.
